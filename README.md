## iBarber

### App Description
Allows user to find a barber, see ratings, book & pay.

### App Idea Evaluation

- Mobile: It is mobile exclusive because it uses location services, maps, real time.
- Story: It is a problem many people have and our friends would say that it would be useful.
- Market: Anyone who has hair and needs a barber
- Habit: A few times per month
- Scope: It will be pretty difficult to build the app because the barbers will need to be part of it and many users and barbers need to be on board.
